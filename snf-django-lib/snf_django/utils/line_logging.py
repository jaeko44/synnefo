    """A StreamHandler with configurable message terminator

    When StreamHandler writes a formatted log message to its stream, it
    adds a newline terminator. This behavior is inherited by FileHandler
    and the other classes which derive from it (such as the rotating file
    handlers).

    Starting with Python 3.2, the message terminator will be configurable.
    This has been done by adding a terminator attribute to StreamHandler,
    which when emitting an event now writes the formatted message to its
    stream first, and then writes the terminator. If you don't want
    newline termination for a handler, just set the handler instance's
    terminator attribute to the empty string.

    This is the StreamHandler class from python 3.2

        exception information is present, it is formatted using
        traceback.print_exception and appended to the stream. If the stream
        has an 'encoding' attribute, it is used to determine how to do the
        output to the stream.
