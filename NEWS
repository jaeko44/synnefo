.. _NEWS-0.16:

v0.16
=====

Released: Tue Nov 11 10:44:57 EET 2014

The Synnefo 0.16 release brings major new features and significant bug fixes
across Synnefo. All users are strongly encouraged to upgrade. Please see
the Synnefo documentation for upgrade instructions to v0.16.

The most notables changes are:

Synnefo-wide
-------------

* Administrator Dashboard: Synnefo 0.16 features a new, integrated Web-based UI
  for managing Synnefo users and resources. It allows the administrator to
  view, filter, modify, and produce stats for all Synnefo resources. This new
  interface will eventually replace the old read-only helpdesk interface, which
  has been obsoleted and will be removed in Synnefo 0.17.
* Pool projects: Projects have been upgraded to a new unified `pool project`
  type in Synnefo 0.16. Resources get assigned to projects, and project members
  may reserve resources from individual projects for their own use. Users may
  choose the project where a new resource be charged (e.g., a new Cyclades VM or
  a new IP address), and re-assign them freely. Pre-0.16 projects are a subset
  of pool projects, with per-user constraints on resource consumption.
* Management command logging: All Synnefo management commands and their outputs
  are individually logged, which may prove very useful for debugging and
  auditing purposes.
* Archipelago has been adopted as the single backend for Pithos. It is a
  unified access layer supporting NFS or Ceph/RADOS-based storage. Current
  Pithos installations over NFS can be migrated seamlessly to Pithos over
  Archipelago over NFS, please see the Synnefo upgrade notes (FIXME)
  and the Archipelago Administrator's Guide for more details.
  Cyclades VMs continue to run over all Ganeti-supported disk templates,
  including DRBD, LVM, Ceph/RBD, and Archipelago.
* Various bug fixes and performance improvements. Please see the Synnefo
  `Changelog` for a complete list.


Cyclades
--------

* Storage: Major improvements in VM storage handling.
  This release introduces a complete implementation of the OpenStack Block Storage
  (Cinder) API v2.0, with distinct /volumes, /snapshots/, /types API endpoints.
* Storage: You can now add and remove virtual disks to and from VMs, even when
  they are powered on, with hot-(un)plugging.
* Storage: You can now snapshot running VMs to files on Pithos, provided
  their storage is backed by Archipelago. New snapshots appear in Pithos and
  are manage-able as Pithos files.
* Storage: You can now spawn new VMs from pre-existing snapshots, regardless
  of their disk template, e.g., you can use an existing snapshot to spawn a
  DRBD VM. If the new VM is to be based on Archipelago, its creation is a thin
  clone and completes in seconds.
  PLEASE NOTE: Snapshot support is a work-in-progress, and Archipelago does not
  yet perform garbage collection on snapshot deletion. This will be fixed in
  Synnefo 0.17.
* Console: Support noVNC-based console for an HTML5-based UI to server consoles
  over VNC, with HTTPS encryption. This removes the need for a working Java Runtime
  Environment in the client's browser.
* Console: Support multiple console types, including VNC over raw TCP sockets
  and VNC over Websockets, with optional encryption.
* Projects: Supports arbitrary (re-)assignment of Cyclades resources to
  individual projects.
* Admin: Support end-to-end checking of the Ganeti-to-Synnefo update path,
  including all intermediate daemons and the Message Queue.
* Numerous bug fixes, performance improvements and improved usability in
  management commands.


Pithos
------

* Pithos has been refactored to use Archipelago as its single unified storage
  backend. Individual storage types (e.g., NFS, or RADOS) are handled by
  Archipelago itself.
* Snapshots: Snapshots created from Cyclades VMs on Archipelago are now
  presented as files on Pithos and may be downloaded via the Pithos UI.


.. _NEWS-0.15.2:

v0.15.2
=======

Released: Tue May 27 13:50:31 EEST 2014

* Bug fix version

.. _NEWS-0.15.1:

v0.15.1
=======

Released: Thu May 15 13:31:37 EEST 2014

Since this version, Synnefo officially supports CentOS, alongside Debian.
The most notable changes are:

* Support for selectable storage backends for Pithos.
  Two options available: NFS or Ceph's RADOS.
* Refactoring and extension of the statistics API, to export detailed
  information about Ganeti clusters, virtual servers, networks, IPv4 pools,
  images, users, auth providers.
* New CentOS installation guide.
* Smaller bug and security fixes. See Changelog file for complete list.


.. _NEWS-0.15:

v0.15
=====

Released: Mon Mar 10 14:01:32 EET 2014

This release brings major new features and significant bug fixes across
Synnefo. All users are strongly encouraged to upgrade. Please see the Synnefo
documentation for upgrade instructions to v0.15.

Cyclades
--------

* Networking: Major improvements in the Network Service.
  This release introduces a complete implementation of the OpenStack Networking
  (Neutron) API v2.0, with distinct /networks, /ports, /subnets, and
  /floatingips API endpoints, replacing the old Cyclades /networks API.
* Networking: Support the creation of arbitrary L2/L3 network topologies,
  with IPv4-only, dual IPv4/IPv6 or IPv6-only functionality.
* Networking: Simplify network administration, support forced networking
  configurations, e.g., a permanent management network across VMs.
* Networking: Introduce new CLI management commands for handling networks,
  subnets, and ports.
* Networking: Support management of floating IPs as a distinct resource in
  Cyclades. Users may create new IPs from admin-defined IP pools, attach
  them to and detach them from VMs arbitrarily, and eventually release them.
* Compute: Support server resize, by changing server Flavors.
  Extend the API and UI accordingly.
  Support fine-grained, per-flavor control of resize and create actions
  ("allow_create" flavor attribute).
* Compute: Support finer-grained accounting of "Active CPUs", "Active RAM"
  resources, in addition to "CPUs", "RAM". Active resources are those of
  running VMs. This allows the administrator to limit currently used VM
  resources to only a subset of the total allocated resources.
* Compute: Support NIC hotplugging. Allow addition and removal
  of NICs on running VMs, without a reboot, to support on-the-fly network
  reconfiguration, e.g., allocation of floating IPs, without the need for NAT.
* Compute: Speed up server reconciliation, by performing operations in parallel,
  across Ganeti backends.
* Compute: Support running snf-vncauthproxy in distinct machine, with control
  channel over TCP. This simplifies firewalling.
* UI: Numerous UI improvements, especially wrt Networking: Better handling
  of multiple NICs per server, with multiple IPv4 and IPv6 addresses per NIC.
  Introduce distinct "IP addresses" view. The "Create New Machine" wizard
  has also been extended to support on-the-fly networking configuration of a
  new machine.
* UI: Introduce distinct "SSH key" view.
* UI: Make Google fonts base URL configurable, to support running in networks
  isolated from the public Internet.
* UI: Support consistent display of pending actions, e.g., "Shutting Down...",
  or "Destroying...". Previously, they were reset upon page reload.
* UI: Support arbitrary groupings of public networks, based on their name.
* Quota: Support quota enforcement through new 'enforce-resource-cyclades'
  management command with fine-grained, per-resource actions, to bring
  current per-user resource usage within specified limits.
* Statistics: Export basic statistics at the /admin/stats/detail API endpoint.
  Also make them available at the CLI.
* Administration: Support mixed DRBD/Archipelago-based Ganeti backends.
  Previously, a Ganeti cluster was defined as Archipelago-only explicitly.

Pithos
------

* API: Numerous bugfixes and improvements across the codebase.
  Improve handling of various corner cases, with better error reporting.
* UI: Support separate view/unsafe domain, for increased security.
  Users may download their files from a specific view domain, distinct
  from the API domain, to prevent malicious user content from accessing
  cookies and other sensitive data set at the level of the API domain.
  This uses newly-introduced support for OAuth2 tokens in Astakos.

Astakos
-------

* Projects: Improved project handling: Better logging of project, application,
  and membership actions.
* Account API: The Account API has been extended to allow full programmatic
  handling of projects.
* Authentication: Remove obsolete /account/v1.0/authenticate call
  in favor of the standard POST /identity/v2.0/tokens Keystone API call.
* Authentication: Support OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant, generate
  and validate OAuth 2.0 access token. This is used by Pithos to support
  distinct API and view/unsafe domains.
* Authentication: Support arbitrary attributes as unique identifiers, e.g.,
  eduPersonTargetedId, or ePPN, by extracting them from the ``REMOTE_USER``
  header. Also fill third-party signup form fields automatically.
* Administration: Introduce numerous new admin commands at the CLI,
  simplify resource and user management commands.
* Resources: Finer-grained resource control, with individual setting of
  resource visibility in the API, the UI, and Projects.
* Statistics: Export basic statistics at the /admin/stats/detail API endpoint.
  Also make them available at the CLI.

Synnefo-wide
------------

* Burnin tests: Significant improvements to the Synnefo Continuous Integration
  mechanism (snf-burnin). It has been extended to also test the Pithos storage
  service.
* Administration: Better error logging, and reporting across Synnefo.
  Admins are notified by default, via email, whenever an unhandled exception
  occurs in a Synnefo worker.
* Administration: Ganeti nodes no longer access the Pithos DB at all.
  Previously, read-only access was required to support spawning VMs
  from Images on Pithos. As of v0.15, Ganeti nodes only need read-only
  access to the Pithos block store (NFS or RADOS).
