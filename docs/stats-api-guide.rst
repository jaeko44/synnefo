Statistics API guide
********************

Overview
========

Synnefo exposes basic statistics about Cyclades and Astakos services via the
`admin` API endpoint of each service. Access to `admin` endpoint is only
allowed to users that belong to Astakos groups defined in the
`ADMIN_STATS_PERMITTED_GROUPS` setting for Cyclades and
`ASTAKOS_STATS_PERMITTED_GROUPS` setting for Astakos, which by default contain
the `admin-stats` group. For example, to allow <user_id> to access stats,
you should run the following commands in the Astakos node:

.. code-block:: console

  snf-manage group-add admin-stats
  snf-manage user-modify --add-group=admin-stats <user_id>


Astakos Statistics
==================

Astakos Service exposes basic statistics by the `admin/stats/detail` endpoint.
The response is a JSON document containing basic information about the
available authentication providers, users and allocated resources.

Information about users and resources is exposed per authentication provider.
However, because some users may using more than one authentication providers,
the special keyword `all` is used to denote the total number of
users/resources, no matter which combination of authentication providers is
used.


Example Response:

Cyclades Statistics
===================

Cyclades Service exposes basic statistics by the `admin/stats/detail` endpoint.
The response is a JSON document containing basic information about the physical
infastructure (Ganeti clusters) and Cyclades virtual servers and networks.

Specifically the response contains the following fields:

 * `clusters`: Information about each Ganeti cluster
 * `servers`: Information about Cyclades Virtual Servers
 * `networks`: Information about Cyclades Virtual Networks
 * `ip_pools`: Information about Cyclades public IPv4 address pools
 * `images`: Information about the images are used by Cyclades Virtual Servers

 }


Finally, to retrieve statistics per Ganeti backend, the backend ID should be
included in the query parameters: `admin/stats/detail?backend=<backend_id>`.
In this case, the response will not contain the 'networks' and 'ip_pools'
sections which are not available per Ganeti backend.
