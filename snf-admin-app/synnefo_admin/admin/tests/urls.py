    This function should be called everytime ADMIN_BASE_URL is altered. It
    tries to propagate this change to the RegexURLResolver Django class by:
    a) Reloading the Admin settings and recalculating the BASE_PATH setting.
    b) Reloading the Admin urls, and thus recreating the Admin URLpatterns,
       which depend on the BASE_PATH setting.
    c) Reloading the Synnefo webproject URLs in order to integrate the new
       Admin URLs with the URLs of Synnefo.

    The cached Django RegexURLResolver has a pointer to the
    'synnefo.webproject.urls' module, so the changes should be instantly
    visible.

    The caller can optionally set a new URLconf to use.

    Before the end of the test, this function should always be called with no
    arguments once the ADMIN_BASE_URL is restored, in order to bring the test
    suite in its initial state.
